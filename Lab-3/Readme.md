# Description
This is my personal portfolio website for Lab 3.  
It shows my skills, projects, and contact info in a single page 

I used:
- Flexbox for header and hero layout  
- CSS Grid for skills and projects  
- Media queries to make it responsive  
- Hover effects for buttons and cards  

Sections in the website:
- Header
- Hero 
- About Me  
- Skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python)  
- Projects 
- Contact Form  
- Footer 


# How to Test Responsiveness
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
2. Resize the browser to see changes 
3. Hover over buttons, skill cards, and project cards to see effects.
